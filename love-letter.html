                <p class="letter-date">This Valentine's Day, 2026</p>
                <p class="letter-to">To the love of my life,</p>
            </div>

            <div class="letter-content">
                <p>
                    There are no words big enough, beautiful enough, or true enough to express what you mean to me. 
                    But I'll try with every fiber of my being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When you came into my life, everything changed. You were broken, yes, but your brokenness showed me your strength. 
                    You survived heartbreak and you're still the kindest, most beautiful person I know. 
                    That guy didn't deserve you. He was a fool.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But I see you. I see every part of you - your dreams, your fears, your beautiful heart. 
                    And I don't just love the good parts; I love every single part of you because it makes you, YOU.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You've changed my life in ways I never imagined. You made me believe in love again. 
                    You made me want to be better, to do more, to dream bigger. 
                    You're my inspiration, my motivation, my reason to smile every morning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know we're far apart right now. West Bengal and here seems like a big distance. 
                    But my love, distance is nothing. Distance can't measure love. 
                    My heart is with you always, no matter how many miles separate us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I want to spend my life with you. Not just moments, not just dates - a whole LIFETIME. 
                    I want to wake up next to you, grow old with you, and love you every single day for the rest of our lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You deserve the best, and I promise to be that. 
                    I promise to love you fiercely, protect your heart, support your dreams, and make you the happiest woman alive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So on this Valentine's Day, and every day after, I want you to know: 
                    You are loved. You are cherished. You are my everything.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Forever yours,
                </p>
